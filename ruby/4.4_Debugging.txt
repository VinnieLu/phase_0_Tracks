Workflow advice.

I have the most trouble with following proper git workflow. I don't save enough. I've noticed it before and I have been trying to fix it. I guess I'm used to hitting "ctrl + s" and that was enough saving. Now I've gotta go into my terminal and do some crazy voodoo. Pushing up to Git and everything. It's been an uphill battle but I know I'm on my way forward.
