What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose is to differentiate between important sections of HTML within your <body> tags. I think header, footer, nav and section seem the most useful. Aside, article and main seem less useful

What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser reads HTML strictly from top to bottom. So whatever elements come first in the HTML will display first, whatever elements are written last will display last.

What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
Sublime has some pre-coded HTML snippets that you can use to make your life easier. I'll definitely create more snippets in the future.

What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
It's kind of hard right now to visualize exactly how I'll use specific semantic tags. It seems like the <div>, <p> and other tags would be enough, I need to figure out specifically how I'll implement the other options in the future. I can improve my understanding by continuing to code, code, code!
