# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
    Version control is a way to manage changes to projects by keeping track of modifications to a file or files. It is a useful way for multiple people to collaborate on a project.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
    A branch is a copy of the original files that a programmer can work on independently. When the programmer is finished modifying the branch, she can merge the branch back into the original tree. You would use a branch to experiment with changes to a file without worrying about messing up the original file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
    A commit is a saved copy of a file that includes some changes from the original. A good commit message is in the present tense and is very specific about what changes were made to the original.
* What is a merge conflict?
    A merge conflict happens when you merge a branch with the original file, and there is some conflict between the changes made and the original file. If the branch simply adds or subtracts content, then there is no merge conflict, but if the branch modifies some content one way, while the original modifies it a separate way, Git doesn't know which version to choose, and the merge conflict must be personally examined and resolved.

Here is some new text to justify another pull request.
